# E2E Test Utils

This repository provides a shared testing library designed to simplify running automated tests across multiple environments from lightweight mocked services to fully integrated real environments.

It extracts and centralizes the common setup code, utilities that were previously duplicated across projects. With this library, teams can:

ðŸš€ Run the same test suite in different environments (mocked, staging, production-like).

ðŸ§¹ Eliminate duplicated test setup code across repositories.

âš¡ Speed up local development by mocking dependencies when needed.

âœ… Increase confidence by reusing the same utilities for real environment runs.
